# Azure DevOps CI Pipeline for Node.js Web Application

## 📌 Introduction  
This project demonstrates how to build a complete **Continuous Integration (CI)** workflow using **Azure DevOps**.  
It includes the development of a simple Node.js web application, automated unit testing using Jest + Supertest, Git version control, and a fully automated CI pipeline executed on a self-hosted Linux agent.

The goal of this project is to simulate a **real enterprise DevOps environment**, including:

- Structuring work using Azure Boards  
- Managing code through Azure Repos and Git  
- Automating builds and tests using Azure Pipelines (YAML)  
- Executing pipelines on a self-hosted agent  
- Practising best CI/CD and DevOps principles  

This project serves as a practical foundation for more advanced DevOps workflows such as CD, containerization, IaC, and cloud deployments.
