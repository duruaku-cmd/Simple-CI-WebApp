# Introduction  
This project demonstrates how to build a complete **Continuous Integration (CI)** workflow using **Azure DevOps Pipelines**.  
It includes a simple Node.js web application with automated tests, showcasing how code can be validated every time a developer pushes changes or opens a pull request.  

The primary objective of this project is to:
- Learn how modern DevOps teams automate the build and validation process  
- Implement a real-world CI pipeline using Azure DevOps YAML  
- Understand how Git, Azure Boards, Azure Repos, and Azure Pipelines work together  
- Build a portfolio-worthy project that reflects industry CI/CD practices
